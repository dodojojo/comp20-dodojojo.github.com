1. Successfully implemented a page activating the reader feature
2. No collaboration
3. 1 hr spent on assignement

Initially had very little text, and enclosed it in an article wrapper. The feature wasn't active. I read something about sufficient content being necessary so four paragraphs were added and the reader feature became active.

As a test I removed the article wrapper and aded line breaks, the feature deactivated.

After that I added more line breaks and enclosed the paragraphs in  the <p> tag, the reader feature reactivated.
