Assignment1 : Personal webpage

A webpage was created with an index page with my name and image, as well as links to a 
version of my resume and a (very) short biography of myself. The content was styled
with css, and two separate files were used. One for devices with a low screen width 
(handhelds) and the other for larger widths (desktops). Both stylesheets aimed to make
the content readable given the device dimensions. All html and css files passed validation.

I didnt work with anyone on this assignement.

This took me roughly 4hrs.
